# API Routes

This project has been simplified to focus on the core authentication functionality.

## Preserved Routes
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - NextAuth.js authentication endpoint
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration endpoint
- `/api/dashboard/placeholder` - Placeholder API for demonstration

## Removed Routes
The following complex API routes have been removed during simplification:
- MQTT integration endpoints
- Device management APIs
- Sensor data endpoints
- Debug log endpoints
- Security system endpoints

To reimplement these features, you would need to create the appropriate API endpoints and corresponding frontend components.
